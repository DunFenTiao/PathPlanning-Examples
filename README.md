# File Organiztion

## main files are in "coverage":

### coverage planner:

1. coverage.cpp: coverage path planner 

### point to point planner:

2. directGo.cpp : point to point path planner in exhausted way;
3. astar.cpp: point to point path planner 

## easy examples in seperate files(each file has seperate main) :
### Point to Point planning 

"p2pFreePrintMap.cpp":show map and path , 

"Point2PointFree.cpp":no map shows

### Coverage planning: 

"CoverageOverLap.cpp": simple spiral coverage, if meets deadlocks, stop

"CoverageDirect.cpp": if meet deadlocks find a new point restart until finish coverage

"CoverageDirectP2P.cpp": if meet deadlocks go to new point by point-to-point planner then restart.
